# About this repo
1. This repository utilises the python application from the https://github.com/charanravi-online/terminal-wiki and adds configuration that packages the python app into a snap application using snapcraft.yaml file. 

# How to install?
## Linux

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/wiki)

## Windows

Download and install the latest ```install_wiki.exe``` from the [release page](https://github.com/charanravi-online/wiki/releases/tag/v1.0)


**Note:** Since this is an unsigned exe file, Windows could flag it as a potential threat and prompt you to click on ```Don't Run```.\
There are two ways to tackle this.

1. You can ignore the promp and click on ```More info``` and it should show another button ```Run Anyway``` right next to ```Don't Run```.\
   Click on ```Run anyway``` and the application should install normally.
3. Right click the file and select ```Properties```.\
   Under the ```General``` tab, near the bottom, you'll see ```This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer```.\
   Select ```Unblock``` and click ```Apply``` or ```OK```.\
   Now you should be able to double click on the installer and install the application noramlly.

<summary><h3>Why is the windows installer not signed?</h3></summary>
It costs quite a lot to get an application signed (and I cannot afford it), hence the workarounds mentioned above.

you can do so by reaching out to me via mail: charanravi-online@gmail.com

## Mac
Coming Soon ðŸ‘€






<!---## Other ways to install on Windows (OLD METHOD, NOT RECOMMENDED)
Since it is a python appication in its core, it can be installed using the setup.py file.\
**Prerequisites:** Python & pip must be installed oin your machine.
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the path where ```setup.py``` is present.
3. Run ```python setup.py install```
4. Now you should be able to use wiki.
5. To uninstall just run ```pip uninstall wiki```-->




# Build your own windows installer using the source code

1. Once you've cloned this repo, running ```pyinstaller.exe --onefile .\src\wiki.py``` will generate two folders ```build/``` & ```dist/```.The ```wiki.exe``` will be located in ```dist/```
2. LICENSE.txt, POST_INSTALL_INFO.txt & PRE_INSTAL_INFO.txt are useful information files required to package the wiki.exe file.
3. The win_installer folder contains install_wiki.iss (make sure to change the file paths accordingly) script that can be run by the [inno setup compiler](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).\
Simply run the script using inno setup compiler and you should generate a Output folder inside win_installer folder. This folder will contain ```install_wiki.exe``` which is our final installation file.


~~Note: Bare in mind that it may not perform as expected on a Windows machine, since it was build for/on Linux machines.
Please do report bugs if you find any, I'll try my best to optimise it for all the platforms as I can.~~
